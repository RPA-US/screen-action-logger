This file controls all the modules that should be activated.
They have been separated from the GUI class to improve readability of the code.
When the user presses the "Start Logger" button in the GUI, this function is started as a process.
It takes as parameters all the modules that should be activated.
They are Boolean variables and are set in the GUI when the user checks a checkbox.
